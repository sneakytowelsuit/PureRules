# PureRules

PureRules is a Java Rules Engine that is designed to balance control between the
engineers and the business users they serve.

The business users know what their rules need to look like.

The engineers know how to control the rule execution.

Why not give both parties what they want? No black boxes hiding complex implementation details, and a simple rule model that can easily be plugged into a basic UI experience.

Simply put, PureRules is a modern rules engine that is easy to use, flexible, and powerful.

## Features
- **Generic Rules**: Define rules using generic types, allowing for flexible and reusable rule definitions.
- **User-Defined Conditions**: Create custom conditions that can be combined in various ways to form complex rules.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Explicitly manage the lifecycle of rules, ensuring predictable behavior and thread safety.
- **Deterministic and Probabilistic Evaluation**: Choose between deterministic or probabilistic evaluation strategies based on your needs.
- **JSON Support**: Load rules from JSON, making it easy to manage and integrate with external systems.
- **Immutability**: Rules are immutable after engine instantiation, ensuring thread safety and predictable evaluation.
- **Simple API**: Easy-to-use API for evaluating rules against input data, with clear and concise results.
- **No External Dependencies**: PureRules is lightweight and does not rely on external libraries, making it easy to integrate into any Java project.
- **Open Source**: PureRules is open source, allowing for community contributions and transparency in development.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend the engine with custom conditions, combinators, and bias strategies to fit specific use cases.
- **Combinators and Biases**: Use various combinators (AND, OR, NOT) and biases (NONE, POSITIVE, NEGATIVE) to control rule evaluation logic.
- **Rule Groups**: Organize conditions into rule groups for better structure and management of complex rules.
- **Evaluation Results**: Get detailed evaluation results, including matched conditions and their outcomes, for better insights into rule execution.
- **Thread Safety**: Designed to be thread-safe, allowing for concurrent evaluations without issues.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring fast evaluation even with complex rule sets.
