# PureRules

PureRules is a Java Rules Engine that is designed to balance control between the
engineers and the business users they serve.

The business users know what their rules need to look like.

The engineers know how to control the rule execution.

Why not give both parties what they want? No black boxes hiding complex implementation details, and a simple rule model that can easily be plugged into a basic UI experience.
